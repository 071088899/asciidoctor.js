=== Disable auto require module

Opal 0.8 is now using modules that you need to require in order to use them.
By default Asciidoctor.js automatically requires the necessary modules.
If you want to disable this behavior you can set the global variable `AsciidoctorConfiguration = {}; AsciidoctorConfiguration.autoLoadModule = false`
